techie.im Style Guide
---------------------

A Repo for documenting the style that we are using for http://techie.im and related
projects.

## Zen of the style

    Always have contrast and depth.

    Leave space, and keep it flat.

    Be presence on small things.

    Few words, mean more.

    Include one cool thing.

    Reusable convention over one-off configuration.

## Example component references

We settled on using purecss.io with a few focus on the elements. 

(p.s. Pure css endorsement: http://www.liangeugene.com/2014/11/purecss-io-vs-bootstrap-3-0/)



### 1. Header text

We use 4 level of header, offering comparison for the styles.

* http://kylestetz.com/ - nice clean flat text

### 2. Highlight content

A flexible card design which allows us to highlight image/video, with explanation text.
